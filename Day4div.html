    <!-- so if i create 2 div so 2nd div goes to nextline hence it eats entire Block
    called block element -->

    <br>

    <span>
        hiihello
    
    </span>

    <span>
        hii hello
    </span>


    key observations between div(block element tag) and span(inline element tag) tag
    <!-- 1> if in block i add display as inline: it becomes span for sure
    & if in span element<span></span> tag: i do display as block it becomes block -->
<!--     
    1.1>so IT WAS ACTUALLY SAID BY COPILOT FRIEND THAT CSS can make block element like <div></div>    tag
    by applying css properties

    and inline element can be made block by css styling

    and according to me this is so far can be applicable to all block and css element
    tags -->
